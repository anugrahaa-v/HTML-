    <p>
      I am a passionate and highly motivated Computer Science student with a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java and SQL, along with a growing interest in backend development and software engineering. My academic journey has equipped me with essential problem-solving abilities and logical thinking skills, which I consistently apply to both classroom projects and self-driven learning.

      I possess excellent communication and interpersonal skills, enabling me to collaborate effectively in team environments and contribute to shared goals. I am a quick learner, eager to explore emerging technologies, and adapt easily to new tools or frameworks. My goal is to secure a role in a dynamic and growth-oriented organization where I can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apply my technical and analytical skills to solve real-world challenges</li>
      <li>Gain hands-on experience in the software development lifecycle</li>
      <li>Work alongside experienced professionals and mentors</li>
      <li>Continuously grow as a developer and a team player</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With a positive attitude, strong work ethic, and a passion for technology, I am ready to embrace new opportunities that allow me to learn, contribute, and make an impact.
